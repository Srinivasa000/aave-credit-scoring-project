Analysis of Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scores
This document provides a detailed analysis of the credit scores generated for wallets on the Aave V2 protocol. The scores, ranging from 0 to 1000, reflect the on-chain reliability and risk profile of each wallet based on their transaction history.

1. Score Distribution
The distribution of scores across all wallets provides a high-level view of the user base's overall financial health and behavior. The scores were binned into 10 groups (0-100, 100-200, etc.) to visualize the landscape.

Distribution Insights:
Healthy User Base: The distribution is heavily skewed towards the higher end, with a large concentration of wallets scoring in the 600-900 range. This is a positive indicator, suggesting that a majority of the user base exhibits responsible, low-risk behavior.

Effective Risk Penalization: There is a significant and sharp drop-off at the lowest end of the spectrum. This confirms that severe risk events, primarily liquidations, are effectively captured and heavily penalized by the model, successfully isolating the highest-risk actors.

The "Average" DeFi User: The peak in the 700-800 range likely represents the "average responsible user." This user actively borrows and repays debt reliably but may not maintain the extremely high collateralization ratios of the top-tier users, representing a healthy balance of activity and safety.

2. Behavioral Analysis by Score Range
By examining the characteristics of wallets at opposite ends of the score spectrum, we can validate the logic of the scoring model.

High-Scoring Wallets (Score: 800-1000)
These wallets represent the most reliable and valuable participants in the Aave ecosystem. They are the bedrock of the protocol's liquidity and stability.

Behavior Profile: The "Ideal DeFi Citizen," typically acting as a long-term liquidity provider or an exceptionally cautious borrower.

Key Characteristics:

Zero Liquidations: They have a perfect record with no history of being liquidated.

Excellent Collateralization: They maintain a very high health factor, often depositing far more value than they ever borrow. Many are net liquidity providers to the protocol.

Flawless Repayment History: They consistently and reliably repay any loans they take out.

Long-Term Engagement: These wallets tend to have a longer, more consistent history of interaction with Aave, demonstrating trust and loyalty over time.

Low-Scoring Wallets (Score: 0-300)
These wallets exhibit clear high-risk, speculative, or mismanaged behavior. They pose the greatest risk to themselves and, in aggregate, to the protocol.

Behavior Profile: The "High-Risk Degenerate," a highly leveraged trader, or a poorly configured bot.

Key Characteristics:

History of Liquidations: This is the single most defining factor. Almost all wallets in this range have had their collateral liquidated at least once to cover an outstanding debt.

Poor Collateralization: They operate with a very low health factor, maximizing their leverage by borrowing as much as possible against minimal collateral.

Unreliable Repayments: They have a low ratio of repay transactions compared to their borrow actions, indicating they are not actively managing or paying down their debt.

Short or Sporadic History: Their activity is often short-lived and focused on aggressive borrowing rather than long-term participation.
