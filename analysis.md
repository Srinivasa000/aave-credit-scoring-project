An Analytical Framework for Assessing Wallet Creditworthiness on the Aave V2 Protocol
1. Analysis of Score Distribution
An examination of the credit score distribution across the entire wallet population provides critical insights into the collective financial behavior and overall health of the Aave V2 ecosystem. The scores were aggregated into deciles (0-100, 100-200, etc.) to facilitate a clear visualization of the user landscape.

Key Observations from the Distribution:
Prevalence of Responsible Behavior: The data indicates a significant right-skew in the score distribution, with a high concentration of wallets in the 600-900 score range. This finding suggests that a substantial majority of the user base engages in responsible, low-risk financial activities, which is a key indicator of a stable and mature protocol environment.

Efficacy of Risk Penalization: A pronounced drop-off is observable at the lowest end of the score spectrum. This pattern confirms that severe negative credit events, most notably liquidations, are effectively identified and heavily penalized by the model. The successful isolation of these high-risk actors underscores the model's utility as a reliable instrument for risk stratification.

Characterization of the Median User: The modal class, situated in the 700-800 range, likely represents the archetypal "responsible user." This profile is characterized by the active utilization of leverage, balanced by consistent and timely debt repayment. While these users may not exhibit the extreme over-collateralization of the highest-scoring wallets, their predictable and reliable engagement signifies a healthy equilibrium between capital efficiency and risk management.

2. Behavioral Archetypes by Score Tier
A comparative analysis of wallet characteristics at the extremes of the score distribution serves to validate the model's logic and provides a qualitative understanding of different user archetypes.

High-Scoring Wallets (Score: 800-1000)
This cohort represents the most reliable and valuable participants within the Aave protocol. Their behavior contributes significantly to market liquidity and overall system stability.

Behavioral Profile: This archetype can be classified as a "Capital Steward," typically functioning as a long-term liquidity provider or a highly conservative borrower who prioritizes capital preservation above all else.

Defining Characteristics:

No Liquidation History: These wallets possess an unblemished on-chain record, free of any liquidation events. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of risk parameters and diligent position management.

Substantial Over-Collateralization: They consistently maintain a high health factor, with deposited assets far exceeding borrowed liabilities. This practice provides a deep liquidity buffer for the protocol and mitigates systemic risk during periods of market volatility.

Impeccable Repayment Record: All debt obligations are met reliably and punctually. This pattern of behavior establishes a strong on-chain reputation for creditworthiness.

Sustained Protocol Engagement: These wallets are characterized by a long and consistent history of interaction with Aave, signifying long-term confidence in the protocol.

Low-Scoring Wallets (Score: 0-300)
This cohort exhibits transactional patterns indicative of high-risk, speculative, or poorly managed financial strategies. These wallets represent the highest potential for individual default.

Behavioral Profile: This archetype may be classified as a "High-Risk Speculator" or a mismanaged automated strategy, characterized by aggressive leverage and a high tolerance for risk.

Defining Characteristics:

Documented Liquidation Events: A history of one or more liquidations is the most definitive characteristic of this group. Such an event serves as a clear and permanent indicator of a failure in debt management.

Insufficient Collateralization: These wallets operate with a low health factor, maximizing their leverage by maintaining collateral levels precariously close to the liquidation threshold.

Irregular Repayment Behavior: The ratio of repay to borrow transactions is consistently low, suggesting a reactive rather than proactive approach to debt management.

Transient or Sporadic Activity: Their engagement with the protocol is often short-lived and focused on aggressive, opportunistic borrowing, demonstrating a lack of a consistent or reliable on-chain history.
